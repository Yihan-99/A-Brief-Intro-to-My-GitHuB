## Welcome to Yihan's GitHub :smile:

Now I'm pursuing my <strong>meteorological master degree</strong> :mortar_board: in University of Maryland.

I'm interested in <strong>cloud, aerosols and machine learning algorithms</strong>, and I'd love to share all my project and codes to this GitHub platform.

I'll try my best to organize my codes and projects, and I would love to learn new things to improve my programming skills.

If you have any suggestions or questions about my projects, feel free to reach out to me via <strong>fangyh99@umd.edu</strong>.
